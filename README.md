# etch-a-sketch

This is a whiteboard that can be used to draw pictures using mouse movements. Clicking inside the white space activates the brush, and clicking again deactivates it.

There are 3 pre/made size options, as well as a slider to make a custom one. The default color is black, and there are buttons to switch to a random selection, an eraser (white) as well as a full range color picker.
